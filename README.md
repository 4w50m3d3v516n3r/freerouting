## Introduction

This software can be used together with all host PCB design software systems containing a standard Specctra or Electra
DSN interface. It imports .DSN files generated by the Specctra interface of the host system and exports .SES Specctra
session files.

## Getting started

There are multiple ways to interact with Freerouting: using the graphical user interface (GUI), the command line interface (CLI) or the Freerouting API. All of these support command line arguments to set the input and output files, or change its settings.

Integrations are available with [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/), [Autodesk EAGLE](http://eagle.autodesk.com/), [Target3001!](https://ibfriedrich.com/en/index.html), [EasyEDA](https://www.easyeda.com/), [tscircuit](https://tscircuit.com/) and [pcb-rnd](https://www.multi-circuit-boards.eu/index.html). [Click here for more details](/docs/integrations.md).

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

1) After launching Freerouting, you will see some instructions on the screen.

2) Click on the `File` menu (top-left corner), then `Open...` and select your input file.

3) Click on the `magic wand` icon to start.

4) While autorouter is running you can follow the progress both visually in the board editor and numerically in the footer.

5) Wait until the router finishes with all the passes, it can take anything from a few minutes to hours.

6) You can now save your routed board as a .SES file in the `File` / Export Specctra Session File menu.

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

When in CLI mode, you typically would have an input file (e.g. Specctra DSN) that you exported from you EDA (e.g. KiCad). If this file has unconnected routes, you would want to wire those with autorouter, and save the result in a format that you can then import back into your EDA (e.g. Specctra SES).

The following command line arguments are most used ones:

* -de [design input file]: loads up a Specctra design file (.dsn) at startup.
* -do [design output file]: saves a Specctra session file (.ses) when the routing is finished.
* -l [language]: "en" for English, "de" for German, "zh" for Simplified Chinese, etc., otherwise it's the system default.
* -inc [net class names, separated by commas]: auto-router ignores the listed net classes.
* -help: shows help.

A typical command line looks something like this:

```powershell
java -jar freerouting-2.0.0.jar -de MyBoard.dsn -do MyBoard.ses -inc GND,VCC
```

This would read the _MyBoard.dsn_ file, do the auto-routing while ignoring the GND and VCC netclasses, and then save the result into the _MyBoard.ses_ file.

For more details see the [CLI documentation](docs/command_line_arguments.md).

### Freerouting API (beta)

Freerouting provides public API endpoints to router PCB boards. The root address of the API is https://api.freerouting.app/v1 and your can quickly check the service status by openning the [https://api.freerouting.app/v1/system/status](https://api.freerouting.app/v1/system/status) URL in your browser.

In order to access all the functions Freerouting can provide, you need to ask for access on [the Freerouting website](https://www.freerouting.app/) first.

Freerouting API and [its API documentation](https://github.com/freerouting/freerouting/blob/master/docs/API_v1.md) are still evolving, so changes and occasional interruptions should be expected.

## Running Freerouting using Java JRE

There are only installers for Windows x64, Linux x64 and macOS. Fortunatelly though the platform independent .JAR files can be run on the other systems, if the matching Java runtime is installed.

You will need the following steps to make it work:

1. Get the current JAR release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/freerouting/freerouting/releases)
2. Install [Java JRE](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/)
    * Select your operating system and architecture
    * Select `JRE` as package type
    * Select `21` as version
4. Run the downloaded JAR file using the installed java

```powershell
java -jar freerouting-2.0.0.jar
```

(macOS: please note that you can't start Freerouting from the Mac Finder, you must use the Mac Terminal instead!)
